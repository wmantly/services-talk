# Services
I was asked to do a presentation on `Mirco Services`.

## Topics

* Benefits – why should an organization use microservices?
* Challenges – what should an organization keep in mind when going to microservices, particularly the “hidden challenges” from  the “unknown unknowns”.
* Development methodologies, procedures, and processes
* Production operations – methods, procedures, and processes
* Tooling – what sorts of tools exist and what sorts of tools does a microservices-focused organization need to know about
* Staffing – are there different staffing needs (size, skills, organization) for microservices vs monolithic?
* Does serverless change the calculus?
